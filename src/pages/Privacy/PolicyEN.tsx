        <strong>Privacy policy</strong>
      </h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Policy of this site has been compiled in accordance with the
        requirements of Russian Federal Law No. 152-FZ dated 07/27/2006 «On
        Personal Data». You can find the full text of the Privacy Policy in
        Russian on the same page if you switch to Russian language.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not only is it near to impossible to translate it into English
        (as well as read it), but many of its items are irrelevant for users
        outside Russia. That&apos;s why I post below the principles I use to
        protect your privacy. Please take note that it is not a full translation
        of the original Privacy Policy.
